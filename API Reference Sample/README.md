# About Sample REST API Reference

These technical writing samples include a YAML-based OpenAPI Specification and a markdown version of API reference. 

    These are mock APIs used for sole purpose of creating documentation sample.

In the YAML, I wrote in-line documentation through description tags using string combined with HTML for formatting. The markdown version contains similar content explainining APIs on a deeper level.

Both the documentation contain description of purpose of the endpoints, available parameters, eligible fields for request body, and field descriptions for schema.

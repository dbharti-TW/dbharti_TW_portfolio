# About Sample REST API Reference

These technical writing samples include a YAML-based OpenAPI Specification and a markdown version of the API reference. 

    These are mock APIs used for the sole purpose of creating a documentation sample.

In the YAML, I wrote in-line documentation through description tags using a string combined with HTML for formatting. The markdown version contains similar content explaining APIs on a deeper level.

Both the documentation contain the description of the purpose of the endpoints, available parameters, eligible fields for the request body, and field descriptions for the schema.
